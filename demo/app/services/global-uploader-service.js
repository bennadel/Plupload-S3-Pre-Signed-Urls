// The globalUploader works hand-in-hand with the global-uploader directive. We are using
// Plupload to handle the actual upload of the binaries (using the HTML5 runtime); and, 
// Plupload needs a DOM element in order to render the runtime. As such, we can't keep the
// entirety of the process inside the service (as we'd like) - it necessarily has to be 
// part in the service, part in the directive. In order to cross that divide, we'll be 
// using events emitted on the $rootScope.
// --
// Emits: globalUploader.fileReadyForUpload
// Expects: globalUploader.fileUploaded
// Expects: globalUploader.fileFailed
// --
// NOTE: We're using $emit() instead of $broadcast() as there is no need for the event to
// travel down through the Scope tree - only the uploader needs to know about it.
